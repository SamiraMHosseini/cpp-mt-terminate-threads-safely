# C++ Concurrent programming 
# Efficient and Safe Thread Termination in C++: A Practical Approach
While C++ does not provide a straightforward method for cleanly terminating threads, 
it is possible to achieve a clean exit using a combination of synchronization primitives such as std::condition_variable, 
std::unique_lock, and std::wait_for. 
By properly utilizing these tools, a thread can be safely and efficiently terminated in a way that avoids potential resource leaks or other undesirable side effects.
# Note

it's possible to move an object into a std::thread instead of making a copy. When an object is moved into a std::thread, the move constructor of the object is called instead of the copy constructor.

Moving an object is generally more efficient than copying it, as it avoids creating a duplicate of the object and instead transfers ownership of its resources to the new object. When an object is moved, its data is "stolen" from the original object and the original object is left in a valid but unspecified state.

To move an object into a std::thread, you can use the std::move function to indicate that you want to transfer ownership of the object's resources.
